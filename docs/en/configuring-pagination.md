# Configuring pagination
To customise the look and feel of the pagination component, simply override the template located at `/blog/templates/Includes/Pagination.ss`

If you have comments enabled, comment pagination is configurable via the [SilverStripe Comments Module configuration](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-comments/blob/master/docs/en/Configuration.md).
